      Â As part of the SHI Robotics Group, a project on a wall climbing robot was being developed. Subject to NDA, further details cannot be revealed.

    <p>
      The current design made it difficult for the robot to navigate on curved surfaces. A redesign of the power transmission system is needed to improve the slope angle limit.
      At the same time, a simulation of the robot would be useful for testing of line following algorithms for autonomous control of the robot on a surface.

  <div id="approach" class="description-section">
    <p>
       Four initial power transmission systems were designed on Solidworks and compared using a Pugh table, with a focus especially on the width reduction that the power
       transmission would enable. After deciding upon a design, I then fully developed it and calculated the required gear ratios to maintain the same RPM needed for the 
       robot to complete the same tasks as before. I constructed and conducted early performance tests on the transmission system and testing continues to occur to refine it.
       
       For the simulation, I began by researching other robot simulations in Unity and recreating the real robot body in a simplified form in Blender. After better understanding the 
       Physics engine used in Unity, I designed the test environment and robot for useful simulations to be created. Some of the simulations included: 
       <ul>
        <li>Classical PID controller testing on a flat and bumpy surface</li>
        <li>Line following using a basic computer vision system</li>
        <li>Surface adaptive PID controller testing and comparison with a classical PID controller</li>
        <li>Wall climbing transitions and line following between transitions</li>
      </ul>

  <button class="accordion"><h2>Results/Outcome</h2></button>
  <div id="results" class="description-section">
    <p>
      A 30% increase in the angle limit of the slope the robot is able to climb, and a test environment was created in Unity for further research into the best control scheme for 
      autonomous control of the robot on various surfaces.
