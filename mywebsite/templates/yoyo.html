      We were tasked with designing the parts to a yoyo using plastic manufacturing processes, like injection molding and 
      thermoforming. For the injection molding process, we also had to design the core and cavity in Solidworks, and create the G-code for a CNC Mill and Lathe to create the parts 
      using MasterCAM.Â

      Our group decided to produce a yoyo that would produce the moire effect. The moire effect is a visual perception that occurs when there are overlapping patterns that have 
      relative translational or rotational motion between them, and can be best seen in this <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/features/freaky-formats-moire-effect/">design webpage</a>. 
      Because of the high rotational rate at which yoyos spin, we had some difficulty coming up with a design that would show the moire effect using relative rotational motion. 
      Instead we decided that translational motion would be the easiest way of creating this effect. To do this, we designed two patterns that would overlap and rotate at the 
      same rate, with one having a pin off axis from the centre of the plastic piece that would be pressed into the bearing of the yoyo.  

      After coming up with a design, we then designed moulds on Solidworks and produced the G-code on Mastercam so that the moulds could be machined on a CNC mill and lathe.
