      The LNS, with the IceCube group in Wisconsin, are focused on a Neutrino Observatory in the South Pole that uses spherical optical sensors placed deep in the ice to detect the 
      produced radiation when Neutrinos travel through the ice and interact. As part of this research, the group was also working on a small desktop muon counter to provide well defined
      tracking of the muons created during the experiment. The counter would also become a teaching tool for undergraduates

      In brief, the device works by using a piece of scintillator attached to a Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM). The scintillator is excited by charged particles (Muons in this case) 
      going through it, and produces light in response, which the photomultiplier then receives and creates a voltage in response. In order to prevent the photomultipliers from 
      reacting to the billions of photons from the lights sources around us, these components are places in a light tight aluminium box that muons can penetrate but photons cannot. 
      This voltage signal is then amplified and digitilised so that it can be read by an arduino and an event is recorded to an OLED screen.

      My role was to work alongside a graduate student to test different design aspects of the device to see what could be improved, as well as to work on building my own one to 
      test how viable this is as an undergraduate project. As part of the team, I was responsible for creating an inexpensive, light tight enclosure from which different 
      light sensitive components could be compared, such as SiPMs and photodiodes, allowing us to debug these components easily and compare their effectiveness. 
      Making the device also involved CAD design, milling, soldering, signal processing and electronics design and testing.
