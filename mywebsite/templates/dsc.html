  <div id="problem" class="description-section">
    <p>
      In order to ensure that the event would be a success, the organisation wanted a number of tasks related to outreach and content creation completed. These included: 
      <ul>
        <li>A database of Special Educational Needs (SEN) schools across London </li>
        <li>A database of active paralympians on Social Media</li>
        <li>The creation of a promotional paralympic video</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <button class="accordion"><h2>Approach</h2></button>
  <div id="approach" class="description-section">
    <u>SEN Database</u>
    <p>
        Given a list of boroughs in London, I automated the search process using <b>selenium</b> to open a government website that lists all schools in London, filtered
        the search for SEN schools in each borough, and from the subsequent list of results, taking the relevant information about each school. 
        Since I was getting information from the same website multiple times, I implemented a rotating list of proxies.
    </p>
    <u>Paralympians on Social Media</u>
    <p>
      I used <b>Beautiful Soup</b> to extract a list of British Paralympians from a wikipedia page, and cross referenced with an official paralympics website of current athletes.
      I then used the python <b>Google Search API</b> to find the url for each athletes Twitter and Instagram, if it exists. I used Beautiful soup again to extract the relevant details
      about their activity, and created a database from this
    </p>
    <u>Paralympic Video</u>
    <p>
      To create the full video, I used <b>Blender</b> video editing software, and used <b>ffmpeg</b> to compress the video. To ensure accessibility, I also wanted to ensure that
      all interviews in the video had subtitles. To create subtitles, I wrote a script that would extract the audio from the video, split the audio into chunks based on silent portions
      and then used the online <b>Google Speech-to-Text</b> to transcribe the content. By combining the text and formatting it into the SRT standard format, I then had subtitles
      available for all videos
